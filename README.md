## Description

This project implements batch processing for reading employee data from Excel/CSV files using Spring Batch. The processed data is saved into a MySQL database, enabling efficient bulk imports.

## Technologies

- Java 17+  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Batch  
- Spring Data JPA  
- MySQL  
- Maven  
- JUnit 5 & Mockito (for unit and integration testing)  
- HikariCP (connection pooling)  

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher installed
- Maven 3.6 or higher installed
- MySQL database configured and running

## How to Run

1) Clone the repository: `git clone <REPOSITORY_URL> && cd excel-batch-processing`
2) Configure database connection properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`
3) Build and run the application using Maven: `mvn clean install && mvn spring-boot:run`
4) The batch job will automatically run on application startup, reading the employees CSV and persisting data into the database.

## How to Test

Run unit and integration tests along with coverage report generation: `mvn clean verify`

## Important Configurations

1) Spring Batch schema initialization controlled by `spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema=always` to auto-create batch metadata tables.
2) JPA auto-ddl controlled via `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` (or `create-drop` during development).
3) Database credentials set in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
4) CSV input file placed under `src/main/resources/` named `employees.csv`.
5) SQL logging enabled via `spring.jpa.show-sql=true` for troubleshooting.
