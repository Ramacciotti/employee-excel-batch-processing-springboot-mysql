## Description

This project implements batch processing for reading employee data from Excel/CSV files using Spring Batch. The processed data is saved into a MySQL database, enabling efficient bulk imports.

## Technologies

- Java 17+  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Batch  
- Spring Data JPA  
- MySQL  
- Maven  
- JUnit 5 & Mockito (for unit and integration testing)  
- HikariCP (connection pooling)  

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher installed
- Maven 3.6 or higher installed
- MySQL database configured and running
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- GitHub account

## How to Run

Docker allows you to run the entire application including the database in containers, isolating dependencies and environment setup.

1) Create a .env file in the project root (and add it to .gitignore) with:

```SPRING_DATASOURCE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=x```
```SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/x?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC```
```SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=x```
```SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=x```

2) Run Docker Compose to build and start the app and PostgreSQL database:

```docker compose up --build```

3) To stop and clean containers: 

```docker compose down -v```

## How to Test

Run unit and integration tests along with coverage report generation: `mvn clean verify`

## Important Configurations

1) Spring Batch schema initialization controlled by `spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema=always` to auto-create batch metadata tables.
2) JPA auto-ddl controlled via `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` (or `create-drop` during development).
3) Database credentials set in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
4) CSV input file placed under `src/main/resources/` named `employees.csv`.
5) SQL logging enabled via `spring.jpa.show-sql=true` for troubleshooting.
6) Dockerfile and Docker Compose files are provided for containerized builds and deployments.
7) GitHub Actions workflow is configured to build, test, and deploy using Docker Compose.
